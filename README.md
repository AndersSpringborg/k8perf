```

### Run iperf 3 benchmark on kubernetes
There are two files in the folder `bandwidth`:
- the server `iperf3-server.yaml`
- the client `iperf3-client.yaml`


## Results
The results of our experiments are located in the results folder.

Images and visualizations of data and analysis are located in the images folder.

visualize.ipynb is a notebook which was used to generate the heatmaps for the iperf3 tests.


#### TODO
- [ ] add a way to specify the namespace
- [ ] Run http benchmark until the server is up to 90% cpu usage
- [ ] loading bar for the benchmark
- [ ] Stream the output of the benchmark (Use streamlit)
